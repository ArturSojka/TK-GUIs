# TK-GUIs
A collection of TKInter GUIs I made for small projects.

## Wallpapers

An app that can be used to scrape Movie and TV Show screenshots and cut wallpapes out of them. TKInter is used to preview the wallpaper in fullscreen and move it around so the user can cut out the wanted part of the image.

## Excel

GUI for a script to clean and transform tabular data in Excel.


## NLP

Small apps made for the Natural Launguage Processing university course.
